 NOW NEXT TOPIC IS KEY PRACTICES OF XP 

1ST KEY PRACTICE OF XP IS PAIR PROGRAMMING 

IN PAIR PROGRAMMING DEVELPOERS ARE work in pairs, LIKE one writing code while the other reviews it
 in real-time. This practice helps improve code quality and facilitates knowledge sharing.

2ND KEY PRACTICE OF XP IS TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT 

IN TEST DRIVEN DEVLOPMENT Developers write tests before writing the actual code. 
ITS ensures that the code meets the requirements and allows for easier detection of bugs early in the development process.

3RD KEYPRACTICE OF XP IS CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION 

IN CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION Code changes are integrated into the main codebase frequently, often multiple times a day.
 This practice helps TO detect integration issues early and ensures that the software is always in a deployable state.

4TH KEY PRACTICE OF XP IS REFACTORING

IN REFACTORING DEVELOPERS Regularly revising and improving the codebase without changing its external behavior. 
Refactoring IS helps TO keep the code clean and maintainable
